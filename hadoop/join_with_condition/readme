# Problem statement is:

What is the total number of viewers for shows on ABC?

How to run this:
Step :
a) Clone repo
b) Create diretory for input or choose address according to your choice:
   ```
   hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop/input
   ```
c) Put data files into hdfs using:
   ```
   hdfs dfs -put join2_genchanA.txt /user/hadoop/input
   hdfs dfs -put join2_gennumA.txt /user/hadoop/input
   ```
d) Create a mapper and reducer.
e) Call hadoop:
   ```
   hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar \
   -input /user/hadoop/input \
   -output /user/hadoop/output \
   -mapper join_mapper.py
   -reducer join_reducer.py
   ```
  f) Download results if you want :
     ```
     hdfs dfs -getmerge /user/hadoop/output/* join_ABC.txt
     ```
  
  Thank you
